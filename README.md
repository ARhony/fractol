# fractol
This program will show you 3 different fractals. Mandelbrot, Julia and another version of Julia(cubbed).<br />
1 -> Mandelbrot<br />
2 -> Julia<br />
3 -> Julia cubed

# How?
```
git clone path fractol_folder
cd fractol_folder
make
./fractol [1<->3] 
```
# Controls
Use the mouse (not a pad, a mouse), use the arrows to move the map.<br />
iteration++ -> O<br />
iteration-- -> I<br />
Change the colors of the set by using the key C.

# Next
Add the OpenCL lirary to boost the program. It gets laggy when the number of iterations is above 75 with a big zoom.
